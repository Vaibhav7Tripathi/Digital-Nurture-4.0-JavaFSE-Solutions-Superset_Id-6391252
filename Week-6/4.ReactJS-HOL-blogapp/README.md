# React App Starter Guide

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Commands

Inside your project directory, you can run the following:

### `npm start`
Starts the development server.  
The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
Hot reloading is enabled, so the page will refresh when changes are saved.  
Linting errors, if any, will also appear in the console.

### `npm test`
Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.  
Learn more about testing here: [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`
Creates an optimized production build inside the `build` directory.  
The output is minified, and filenames are hashed for caching.  
Your app is now ready to be deployed.

For deployment details, check: [Deployment Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`
**Warning: This is irreversible!**  
Executing this will expose the underlying configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) so you can fully customize the setup.  
Only use this if you require advanced configurations beyond the default setup.
